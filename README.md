# Huge-Text-Analyzer
Huge Text Analyzer using topic modeling techniques

This software is designed to analyze large volumes of text data using topic modeling techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). It is particularly well-suited for analyzing customer complaints or other forms of feedback data to identify underlying issues and root causes.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Streamlit

## Features

The application offers the following features:

Upload text data in various formats, including CSV, TXT, and JSON
Choose the number of topics to model and the specific algorithm to use (LDA, NMF, or LSA)
Visualize the most frequent words associated with each topic using a word cloud
Export topic modeling results and word cloud visualizations as CSV or image files
View statistics and metrics related to the topic modeling, including coherence and perplexity scores

## How to install

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install all the requirements using requirements.txt file in the repo.
